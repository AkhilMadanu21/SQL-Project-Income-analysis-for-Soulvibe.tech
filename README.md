## Overview
This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills by analyzing an employee income dataset. It involves data import and solving various business problems using SQL queries.


## Project structure 
- **Database Setup**: Creation of the `my_project` database.
- **Importing data**: Importing sample csv file into tables.
- **Business Problems**: Solving 12 specific business problems using SQL queries.
 
## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_project;
```

## Data Import
